This plug-in can easily convert every colored image (in an html page) into a B&W greyscale image.
Read the wiki for the usage ( https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini/jQuery.BlackAndWhite/wiki/Simple-and-Fast-usage ).

IMPORTANT
the script works only for the images hosted on the same server in which the page is loaded!
